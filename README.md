# Unifying Evaluation of Machine Learning Safety Monitors - Experiments

This repository presents all the necessary code to reproduce the experiments from our ISSRE 2022 paper: 
**Unifying Evaluation of Machine Learning Safety Monitors**   

The experiments for each of the three use cases were conducted independently. 
Hence, all the code and dependencies are presented in separated folders (Use cases).
